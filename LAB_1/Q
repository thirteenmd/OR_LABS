Optimize the trafic from station Stefan cel Mare to Circul.
	Keep the same number of arrivals.
	Reduce the instances when there are 2 or more troleybuses arrived at the same time.
	Make the time of waiting for a troleybus minimal.

CHANGING TIME FOR A STATION WILL CHANGE THE TIME OF ARRIVAL TO TE OTHER STATIONS


Q:
How to save the data?
	Graph with nodes as stations. +
How to add the edges / transport routes?
	Create adjacency matrix /maybe/


To do:
	Determine the nedded route from Stefan cel Mare to Circul. /Compare te first arrival time of te troleybuses./



FOR PROBLEM 1:
	We work only with the traffic from Stefan cel Mare to Circul station! 
	ALSO we suppose that the troleybus go from ScM to Circul using the same route that they go from Circul to ScM.
	~So we will analyse the data from stations: Stefan cel Mare -> ASEM -> Circul.~
